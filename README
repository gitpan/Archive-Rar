This is the README file for Archive::Rar, the Perl module for creation
and manipulation of rar files.

* Installation

Archive::Rar uses the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (optional but recommended)
make install

This module uses no C-coded parts in itself, but it uses
the rar command available under Windsows (WinRar) and Linux.
Archive::Rar don't work without that.

* important changes for version 0.072.

Fixes a problem with systems that don't like open files being deleted.
It also has an explicit copyright notice so folks like Debian can
redistribute it in peace, and an new custodial maintainer due to
Calle's suffering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

Get better soon, Calle!

* important changes for version 1.9

This is the first public version

If you use this module at all, please mail
<jmbperl@hotmail.com> and tell me what
you think of it.
